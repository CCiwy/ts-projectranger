Certainly! Here's a modified version of Phase 3 breakdown with checkboxes for each step, suitable for outputting as a `.md` file:

#### Phase 3: User Experience

- [ ] Implement Step-by-Step Experience Selection
  - [ ] Create a component for the initial step that allows users to select their experience level.
  - [ ] Store the selected experience level in the application state.
  - [ ] Design and implement a navigation system that guides users through each step of the project selection process.

- [ ] Project Type Selection
  - [ ] Create a component for selecting the project type (fullstack, backend, frontend).
  - [ ] Store the selected project type in the application state.
  - [ ] Ensure that the user can navigate back to previous steps if they want to change their selection.

- [ ] Language Selection
  - [ ] Design a component that allows users to select the programming language(s) they want to work with.
  - [ ] Store the selected language(s) in the application state.
  - [ ] Provide options for selecting multiple languages, if applicable.
  - [ ] Consider using checkboxes or multi-select dropdowns for the language selection UI.

- [ ] Database Integration
  - [ ] Set up a database (such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to store project entries and user data.
  - [ ] Create the necessary database schema and tables to represent project entries.
  - [ ] Implement the necessary database queries or API endpoints to retrieve project matches based on user preferences.
  - [ ] Integrate the database connection into your application codebase.

- [ ] Randomizer Logic
  - [ ] Design and implement a randomizer logic that selects one project match from the database.
  - [ ] Retrieve project matches based on the user's selected experience level, project type, and programming language(s).
  - [ ] Randomize the results and display a single project match to the user.
  - [ ] Consider displaying additional project details, such as project description, technologies used, and any specific requirements.

- [ ] User Interface Updates
  - [ ] Continuously update the user interface to reflect the selected options and the randomized project match.
  - [ ] Update the UI elements dynamically as the user progresses through the steps and the project match is displayed.

- [ ] Error Handling and Validation
  - [ ] Implement error handling and validation mechanisms to handle invalid inputs or unexpected errors.
  - [ ] Display appropriate error messages or notifications to guide users in case of errors or missing data.
  - [ ] Ensure that the user experience is smooth and intuitive, even when errors occur.
